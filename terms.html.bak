                limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,
                which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In
                these states, each party's liability will be limited to the
                greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
              <h1>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h1>

                course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade
                practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company
                provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation
                of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements,

                other software, applications, systems or services, operate
                without interruption, meet any performance or reliability
                standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or
                will be corrected.</p>
              <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of
                the company's provider makes any representation or warranty of
                any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or

                of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
                consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations
                may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and
                limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the
                greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
              <h1>Governing Law</h1>

                extent possible under applicable law and the remaining
                provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
              <h2>Waiver</h2>
              <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or
                to require performance of an obligation under this Terms shall
                not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require
                such performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver
                of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
              <h1>Translation Interpretation</h1>
              <p>These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if We have
                made them available to You on our Service. You agree that the
